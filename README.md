# Deploy Anything to the Internet in One Click

Leverans is a deployment tool that makes launching applications and services to the web straightforward and fast. It automates the heavy lifting while keeping you in full control.

**Powered by Docker, uses Traefik as a reverse proxy, built with Rust.**

## What Makes Leverans Different?

Unlike other open-source solutions (Coolify, Kamal, Dokploy, etc.):

- Deploy anything, any way you want.
- No need for SSH, RCE, DockerHub, or Git.
- CLI-based, with all configurations in a single file.
- Deploy or update entire projects with one command.
- Works on any server with minimal requirements (0.5 vCPU, 500 MB RAM).
