## Remix + PocketBase example

An example application that was created in Remix.js. Uses PocketBase as BaaS. Which is an ideal solution
for creating Full-Stack applications. Follow the guide below to get them up and running.

## Deployment with Leverans

1. open the deploy.yaml file, and change the domain fields to your domains.
2. Run the command `lev deploy --build front`.

and that's it, now go to your PocketBase, and create a ‚Äúposts‚Äù collection and make all the methods public.
And go to your Remix app, where you will see that everything is working fine.
