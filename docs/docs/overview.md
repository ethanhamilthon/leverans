## What are we striving for?

We are not alone in tackling the challenge of deploying applications so they run smoothly every time while keeping the
process simple and fast. Many share this goal, but we take a unique approach to solving it.

Docker has already set the standard for application packaging, and Docker Swarm handles container orchestration effectively for
small to medium-scale setups. But the real bottleneck lies in repetitive tasks: building images, pushing them to registries,
creating or updating services, linking them, configuring reverse proxies with SSL, and more. These tasks are dull, prone to errors,
and distract developers from what truly mattersâ€”the application itself.

Our mission is to build a complete solution that automates these steps, freeing developers to focus on meaningful decisions.
Let the infrastructure handle itself, so you can build better, faster, and smarter.
